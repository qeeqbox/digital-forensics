Digital Forensics is the process of finding and analyzing electronic data

### Steps
#### Identification
Find the relevant digital evidence in storage, hardware, network (E.g., events, packets, or raw data)

#### Collection
Preserve and isolate the relevant digital evidence (The evidence should not be changed at any time)

#### Analysis
Analyze the isolated evidence and drawing conclusions (This step could take a long time because raw data might need parsing)

#### Documentation
Compile all the findings and processes into documents or records (They must be formal in case of being studied or presented in court)

#### Presentation
Present the gathered evidence and the documents, or summarization of drawing conclusions.
